                            I can say that we've done so much for each other, for ourselves and for the people around us. My favorite event
                            happened in us this year was when you passed your LPT exam, while other's saying that "LPT nako" for met it was
                            "may LPT nako" so proud of what you've done this year love and I am always looking for all the greatness that
                            you will achieve in the future. Our first travel together was the next favorite thing in my list, 
                            exploring the island with you was my next favorite thing after exploring you. I could walk all day as long as
                            with you, kaso tamad ka maglakad so mag momotor tayo. Looking forward for future travel or adventure with you,
                            as Mr. Incredibles said "You are my greatest adventure".
